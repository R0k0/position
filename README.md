Positioning elements in page

Hi,
(sorry for my poor knowlage of English)
my intention is to make website on which everyone can learn about positioning elements on webpage.
I had always problem when I learning stuff that I can't imagine what is that. So always when I need something to see how it's work I had need first to learn some program to test (see) what I done. Some great programs are Blender, GIMP, Synfig, Inkscape and other. But it is little hard to me to learn for example Blender (which is great for most of things), (later on I think to learn Python to make scripts for thoss programs)
Because on web development is possible make many great stuff without installing (hard to learn for make GUI) programs on PC, asking admin rights or need to download programs.
I have some obligation for all of us which don't understand positioning elements in html. To make some web-site most for learning positioning elements in html.

Why I do that?
Because I started on FreeCodeCamp and always when I want do something I stop on positionig. They never go where need to be, they don't move one after other and so one. I realy want to learn web development but I can't move from positioning. One other think is when I need to make some website in most cases they don't work in older IE or Firefox.

In begining I will not make some great pages even maybe never, but trough this page I will trying to understand positioning and to make page later on so other can understand (learn) how to fix they problem about positioning element in html.

What is my intention about this project (is it is (I don't understand github much))?
To learn positioning elements in html.
To help (without interaction) others, so that they don't need pass same problems.
And maybe (if this work how I think) later to make link of css so other can link they website, so that they don't need to copy everything to thems page, and make some css which will work on IE6 up, and Firefox (to download or copy code).

I know many things are on web (I need to find them and learn). I want that people can find and learn fast on many different examples about positioning and that they can fast jump on making great websites without problems whisch I have.

Best regars to everyone and goodluck and happy coding. :)
